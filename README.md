Making an Analysis on my final project experience

## Role(s) I played in the project

My primary responsibility of the group was to be the leader/ organizer of the group. I created our github repository consistening of the three branches(one for each group member) and also picked the dataset that we used with the agreement of the rest of the team. Some of the roles I ended up taking on were cleaning the dataset, helping with the machine learning process and helped create an HTML file to create the dashboard. The greatest personal challenge that was faced during thid project was grouping with two other people so we can come up with a cohesive idea of what direction we wanted to take using this dataset. With our group's constant communication via slack we were always able to figure it out as a team.

## Team assessment 

Our team would communicate through slack on almost a daily basis regarding the project, providing links, new data sets and personal feedback. One other way or team would group is via zoom calls once every week. On the zoom calls we would discuss each of our roles, where we are in regards to building the project but also provide a landing hand if someone needed help on their part of the project. What helped this group so much is we were willing to take on each others roles, provide feedback but most importantly communicate. Communication daily was easily our biggest strength.

## Project summary

This project was the analysis of the 2014-15 NBA shot log data set. In the project we used Python, R, SQL and HTML to create visualizations, databases, machine learning algorithms and a project dashboard. We used various machine learning techniques such as oversampling, ensemble classifiers and SVC. The highest success rate we had was the SVC model that had a 65% accuracy score.
